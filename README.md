# ACTracker (  Multi-person Tracking Method considering Appearance Changes ) version2.0

PHALP' is from https://github.com/shubham-goel/4D-Humans

ByteTrack code is implemented in phalp_folder/phalp/external/deep_sort_/tracker.py 

DelburGAN_V2 is used to deblur detected images (https://github.com/VITA-Group/DeblurGANv2 )

You should just change the original Humans4D(PHALP') files which have same name as the code I poseted.
